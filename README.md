# Statistics for Data Scientists in Python

My implementation of concepts in Python from the book "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts" [Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962)

This repository is inspired by the original [R code](https://github.com/andrewgbruce/statistics-for-data-scientists) from the book's authors.
